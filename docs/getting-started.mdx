# Getting Started

Get up and running with Clawforge in a few steps.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+
- **pnpm** 10+
- **Docker** (for the database and services)

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Start the Dev Environment

### Option 1: Docker Compose (recommended)

Spins up PostgreSQL, the API, web app, and OpenClaw together:

```bash
docker compose -f infra/compose/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

### Option 2: Run packages individually

Start any package on its own:

```bash
# API (port 4000)
pnpm --filter @clawforge/api dev

# Web (port 3000)
pnpm --filter @clawforge/web dev
```

Or run everything at once:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
