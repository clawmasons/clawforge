# Getting Started

## 1. Set Up Your Account

1. Sign up at [Clawforge.org](https://clawforge.org).
2. From the dashboard, select a **program** to launch (e.g. Engineering, Support, or a custom program).
3. Navigate to **Settings > Org Tokens** and generate an org token. Copy it — you'll need it in the next step.

## 2. Run OpenClaw Locally

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, then run:

```bash
# Install the Clawforge CLI
npm install -g clawforge

# Set your org token
export CLAWFORGE_TOKEN=<your token>

# Initialize your local environment
clawforge init

# Start a bot with your chosen program and role
clawforge bot start --name mybot --program engineering --role bug-fixer
```

`clawforge init` pulls down your org configuration and sets up the local Docker environment. `clawforge bot start` launches a containerized OpenClaw bot scoped to the program and role you specify.
