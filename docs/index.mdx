# Introduction

[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) is a fantastic ecosystem for building clawbots — but security is a missing piece. Laws do not apply to AI (yet). If an AI breaks the rules, the person running it is the one held accountable. We can still have fun building and deploying clawbots, but we need to ensure they do exactly what we approved them to do.

**Clawforge** is an open-source project built with years of security experience, designed to give you visibility and control over every clawbot you run.

## Cloud Offering

[Clawforge.org](https://clawforge.org) provides a managed portal for your clawbots:

- **Free** — Use the portal to manage clawbots you run yourself.
- **Subscription** — Hosting for your bots, business use, and premium features.
- **Private AWS Deployment** — A dedicated deployment in your own AWS account.

## Self-Hosted

You can clone the repo and run the portal locally, or deploy it on your own infrastructure. The only restriction is that you cannot launch a competitive service using the project.

## Dependencies

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install clawforge CLI
